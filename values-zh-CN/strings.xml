m11kkaa 多系统启动功能制作和建议
Quarx2k 关键的帮助和冰淇淋三明治系统
Epsylon3 冰淇淋三明治系统
adamo3957 辛苦的测试
XDA 论坛

需求
===========
1) 已root安装了bootmenu的Motorola Defy/Defy+/Bravo
2) 具有m11kkaa开发的Multiboot特性0.51版

特性
========
* 支持任意数量的系统
* 完整支持multiboot 0.51
* 支持多个镜像
* 创建、回收、格式化虚拟镜像
* 删除、重命名、编辑每个系统的描述
* 显示虚拟系统的大小
* 更多特性等待发掘

这个是神马？
=============
一个sd卡上虚拟系统镜像的管理软件

如何使用？
================
1) 首先使用的前提是安装有一个带有bootmenu的非官方系统，最好是最新的CM9/CM7每夜版，这样可以获得最新的bootmenu。
2) 然后刷写m11kkaa制作的defy_multiboot_v0.5.1.zip，你可以从这里获得它。
3) 安装多系统启动管理1.30.apk
4) 打开多系统启动管理，从选项中建立新的虚拟镜像文件。然后你可以看到新的虚拟镜像列了出来，你刚刚建立了你的第一个虚拟系统。
5) 如果你需要多系统启动管理检测到已经存在的虚拟系统镜像，请讲它们移动到/mnt/sdcard/multiboot下。
6) 使用multiboot 0.51的教程在这里，感谢joydeep1985。
7) 如果你从leodfs的multiboot软件迁移过来，你需要从第1步重新做起。希望你对哪些步骤可以跳过有清楚的了解。
8) 多系统启动管理的重置选项十分明了，请善用条目菜单（长按该条目）。
9) 请报告任意特性的bug。我现在有一点忙，但我以后会继续完善的。
10) 这个应用目前同时可以在虚拟系统中运行。
11) 这个应用可以在所有带有2nd init的GB和ICS系统中运行。"</string>
